## Release notes

### Beta 1 (2017-12-11)

The biggest unresolved issue in this build is how best to determine
whether to replace "bitcoin" with "tulip" or "tulips" for a given
instance. Mostly I'm erring on the side of "tulips" by default, but it
doesn't always work well. I would love to hear ideas from others for
how to improve this. Right now I'm doing everything with regex
matching, so I can only do so much in terms of grammar detection.
